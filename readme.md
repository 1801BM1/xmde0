## Abstract

The fixture boards to run the ancient original CPU chips over FPGA boards
of Terrasic DE0/DE1/DE2 series. CPU chip is soldered into fixture and then
connected to the FPGA board extension slot. The FPGA board provides necessary
resources to run the original CPU.

## Supported CPU

- 1801BM1 - USSR microprocessor, no DEC prototype, proprietary die design
- 1801BM2 - USSR microprocessor, no DEC prototype, proprietary die design
- 1801BM3 - USSR microprocessor, no DEC prototype, proprietary die design
- 581 microprocessor chipset, is the clone of DEC LSI-11
